Analyze the file `/prompts/add-customer/requirements.md` and create a detailed plan for the improvements of this project. Write the plan to `/prompts/add-customer/plan.md` file. Don't apply any changes on code at this stage, just write the plan.

------

Create a detailed enumerated task list according to the suggested enhancements plan in `prompts/add-customer/plan.md`
Task items should have a placeholder [ ] for marking as done [x] upon task completion. Write the task list to `prompts/add-customer/tasks.md` file. Don't apply any changes on code at this stage, just write the task list.


------

Complete the task list `prompts/add-customer/tasks.md`.
Inspect the  `prompts/add-customer/requirements.md`,
`prompts/add-customer/plan.md` and  `prompts/add-customer/tasks.md` (task list). Implement the tasks in the task list.
Focus on completing the tasks in order. Mark the task complete as it is done using [x].
As each step is completed, it is very important to update the task list mark and the task as done [x].
