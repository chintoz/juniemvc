# Vite Configuration
For development, configure a proxy for the Spring Boot server running at `http://localhost:8080`

The production build output path will be configured to use `src/main/resources/static`.

The base path should be configured to `/`.

Provide directions to setup and configure Vite to build the web resources.

If a .env file is used, configure vite properly to substitute the properties.

# Maven Configuration
Provide Instructions to configure Maven for manging the build.

Use the following Maven plugin to manage the web assets and adding them into the Spring Boot build.

```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
        <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.15.1</version>
    </plugin>
```

Provide information about how to configure and use the maven plugin.

Update the Maven Clean plugin to clean the dist directory of the vite build.

# React Application
Inspect the Spring MVC controllers and OpenAPI documentation in `openapi/openapi/openapi.yaml` for addition information
about the API endpoints.

The guide should include directions for:
* Implementing the CRUD operations for the defined APIs
* Implementing a standard layout and user navigation
* Provide an API service layer for a reusable Axios Instance
* Use custom hooks for state logic
* Code formatting with prettier
* Linting with ESLint
* Gracefully hand API errors
* Complete test coverage of components

Do not implement authentication. The API endpoints are not secured.

Spring Boot is configured to serve static resources from `reources/static`. The static resources will resolve from the root
of the project. For example, a resource added to `resoures/static/js/foo.js` will resolve as `http:\\localhost:8080\js\foo.js`.

# Guidelines Update
Inspect the file `.junie/guidelines.md` and plan a section to update the guidelines with
the updated project structure and commands to build and test the new frontend react application.

### Guide Outline
The guide should provide detailed step by step instructions to guide an experienced Java
developer to add a React UI application into a Spring Boot project.

**Part 1: Foundation and Setup**
1. **Introduction & Final Goal**
    - Briefly state the objective: to seamlessly integrate a modern React frontend into a Spring Boot project.
    - Describe the final state: a single Maven build that produces a self-contained Spring Boot JAR with the React UI included.

2. **Recommended Project Structure**
    - Provide a visual tree diagram of the final project structure.
    - Explain the rationale behind placing the frontend source code in `src/main/frontend`.

3. **Initializing the React + TypeScript Project**
    - Step-by-step commands using `npm create vite@latest`.
    - Explain the key files generated by Vite (`vite.config.ts`, , `src/main.tsx`). `package.json`

4. **Installing Dependencies and Setting up UI Framework**
    - Provide `npm install` commands for all necessary dependencies (`axios`, `react-router-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn-ui`, etc.).
    - Guide the user through initializing Shadcn UI via its CLI (`npx shadcn-ui@latest init`).

**Part 2: Build Integration and Configuration**
1. **Maven and Vite: A Symbiotic Build**
    - **Configuration:`frontend-maven-plugin`**
        - Provide the full XML configuration for the plugin in . `pom.xml`
        - Detail the two essential `<execution>` blocks: one for `npm install` and another for `npm run build`, tying them to the Maven `generate-resources` phase.

    - **Vite Configuration for Spring Boot:**
        - **Development:** Configure the Vite dev server proxy in `vite.config.ts` to forward API calls to the running Spring Boot application, solving CORS issues during development.
        - **Production:** Configure the `build.outDir` in `vite.config.ts` to output the final static assets directly into Spring Boot's directory. `src/main/resources/static`

**Part 3: Building a Robust Frontend Application**
1. **Enhancing the Developer Experience (DevEx)**
    - Introduce and configure **ESLint** (for linting) and **Prettier** (for code formatting).
    - Provide sample configuration files (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`).
    - Add `lint` and `format` scripts to . `package.json`
    - _This section helps introduce Java developers to the powerful tooling that maintains code quality in the JavaScript ecosystem._

2. **End-to-End Type Safety with OpenAPI**
    - Introduce `openapi-typescript-codegen` to automatically generate TypeScript types from the project's file. `openapi.yaml`
    - Add a new `generate-api-types` script to . `package.json`
    - _This is a key improvement that brings Java-like type safety to the frontend, ensuring API changes on the backend are immediately caught by the TypeScript compiler on the frontend._

3. **Crafting the React Components**
    - **Type-Safe API Service:** Create a dedicated service module (`src/services/productService.ts`) that uses Axios and the auto-generated types for making API calls.
    - **Custom Hooks:** Create a `useProducts` hook to encapsulate the logic for data fetching, loading state, and error handling. This separates business logic from the UI.
    - **UI with Shadcn and Radix:** Build the React components using the pre-built, accessible components from Shadcn UI, showing how to import and use them.

**Part 4: Running and Testing**
1. **Unit Testing the Frontend**
    - Provide a clear example of how to write a unit test for a React component using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
    - Demonstrate how to mock the API service to test the component in isolation.

2. **The Integrated Workflow: Running and Building**
    - **Development Mode:** Provide clear, side-by-side instructions for running the Spring Boot backend and the Vite dev server simultaneously for a live-reload experience.
    - **Production Build:** Instruct the user on how to run a single `mvn clean package` command to build the entire application, and then how to run the resulting executable JAR.

3. **Updating Project Guidelines**
    - Provide the final text for the file, summarizing the new project structure, build commands (`mvn package`, `npm run dev`), and testing commands (`npm test`). `.junie/guidelines.md`
