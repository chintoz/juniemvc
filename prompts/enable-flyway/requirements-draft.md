I'd like to enable Flyway in my project. Once it's enabled, I'd like to populate the database with some initial data in the entity Beer. It should populate data with the most famous beers in the world.
Apart from initializing the database, I also want to ensure that the Flyway migrations are properly configured and that the application can run with these migrations applied. It means that I need to create tests to verify that the migrations work as expected and that the initial data is correctly inserted into the database.
