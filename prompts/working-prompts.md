# Junie Prompts
Inspect the file `prompts/requirements-prompt-draft.md`. Use this file to create a developer guide to
implement a React front end for this project. Update and improve this developer guide using the context
of this project. The guide should be organized into clear actionable steps.

Write the improved guide to `prompts/requirements.md`.


--------------------

Your goal is to create a detailed, step-by-step guide for a Java developer to add a React frontend to an existing Spring Boot application. The final result should be a single, self-contained Spring Boot JAR that includes the compiled React UI.
The guide should be structured in multiple parts, providing clear instructions, code snippets, and explanations at each stage.
### **Part 1: Foundation and Setup**
1. **Introduction & Final Goal**
    - State the objective: Seamlessly integrate a modern React frontend into a Spring Boot project.
    - Describe the final state: A single Maven build that produces a self-contained Spring Boot JAR with the React UI included.
    - Mention that the Spring Boot backend already provides RESTful APIs for Beers, Customers, and Beer Orders.

2. **Recommended Project Structure**
    - Provide a visual tree diagram of the final project structure, placing the frontend source code in . `src/main/frontend`
    - Explain the rationale for this structure.

3. **Initializing the React + TypeScript Project**
    - Provide the `bash` commands to create the directory and initialize a new Vite project using `npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts`. `src/main/frontend`
    - List the key files generated by Vite.

4. **Installing Dependencies and Setting up UI Framework**
    - Provide the `npm install` commands for the following dependencies:
        - **Core:** `react@19.1.0`, `react-dom@19.1.0`, `react-router-dom@7.6.36`, `axios@1.10.0`
        - **Types:** `@types/react@19.1.0`, `@types/react-dom@19.1.0`, `@types/node@24.0.1`
        - **UI & Utilities:** `@radix-ui/react-primitive@3.2.1`, `tailwindcss@4.1.10`, `tw-animate-css@1.3.4`, `tailwind-merge@3.3.1`, `postcss@8.5.5`, `autoprefixer@10.4.20`, `clsx@2.1.1`, `class-variance-authority@0.7.1`, `lucide-react@0.515.0`
        - **Dev Dependencies:** `typescript@5.8.3`, `@vitejs/plugin-react@4.5.2`, `jest@30.0.0`, `@types/jest@29.5.14`, `@testing-library/jest-dom@6.6.3`, `@testing-library/react@16.3.0`, `eslint`, `prettier`

    - Guide the user through initializing Tailwind CSS (`npx tailwindcss init -p`) and Shadcn UI (), specifying the configuration choices for Shadcn. `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
    - Show how to add specific Shadcn UI components like `button`, `card`, `table`, etc.

### **Part 2: Build Integration and Configuration**
1. **Maven and Vite Integration**
    - **Configuration:`frontend-maven-plugin`**
        - Provide the full XML configuration for the `com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:1.15.1` in . `pom.xml`
        - Specify `<nodeVersion>` as and `<npmVersion>` as `11.4.0`. `v22.16.0`
        - Detail the executions for `install-node-and-npm`, `npm-install`, `npm-build`, and `npm-test`, linking them to the appropriate Maven phases.

    - **Maven Clean Plugin:** Show how to update the `maven-clean-plugin` to remove the compiled frontend assets from . `src/main/resources/static`

2. **Vite Configuration for Spring Boot**
    - Provide the complete file. `vite.config.ts`
    - Configure the Vite dev server to proxy requests to . `/api``http://localhost:8080`
    - Set the production to `../resources/static`. `build.outDir`
    - Explain how to handle environment variables with a file and the `envPrefix: 'REACT_APP_'` setting. `.env`

### **Part 3: Building a Robust Frontend Application**
1. **Enhancing Developer Experience (DevEx)**
    - Provide configuration files for ESLint () and Prettier (). `.eslintrc.cjs``.prettierrc`
    - Add `lint`, `format`, and `test` scripts to . `package.json`

2. **End-to-End Type Safety with OpenAPI**
    - Instruct on installing . `openapi-typescript-codegen`
    - Provide an npm script () to generate TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification file, placing the output in `src/types/api`. `generate-api-types`

3. **Crafting the React Components**
    - Provide the code for a reusable Axios instance in `src/services/api.ts` and an example service module for beers (`src/services/beerService.ts`) that uses the generated types. **Type-Safe API Service:**
    - Show how to create custom hooks (`src/hooks/useBeer.ts`) to encapsulate data fetching, state management (loading, error), and filtering logic. **Custom Hooks:**
    - **UI Components:** Provide a complete example of a React component (`src/components/BeerList.tsx`) that uses the custom hook and Shadcn UI components to display, filter, and paginate data.

### **Part 4: Running and Testing**
1. **Unit Testing the Frontend**
    - Provide an example of a unit test for the `BeerList` component using Jest and React Testing Library (`src/components/BeerList.test.tsx`).
    - Demonstrate how to mock the API service and hooks. `react-router-dom`
    - Show the necessary Jest configuration (`jest.config.js`) and setup file (`src/setupTests.ts`).

2. **Integrated Workflow: Running and Building**
    - Give clear instructions for running the Spring Boot backend (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`) and the Vite dev server (`npm run dev`) concurrently. **Development Mode:**
    - Explain how to run a single `./mvnw clean package` command to build the entire application and how to run the final JAR file. **Production Build:**

3. **Updating Project Guidelines**
    - Provide a template to add to the project's guidelines. This section should summarize the new frontend structure, build commands, and development workflow.


Write the improved guide to `prompts/plan.md`.

--------------------

Create a detailed enumerated task list according to the suggested enhancements plan in `prompts/plan.md`. Task items should have a placeholder [ ] for marking as done [x] upon task completion. Write the task list to `prompts/tasks.md` file.

--------------------

Complete the task list in `prompts/tasks.md`. Use information from `prompts/requirements.md` and `prompts/plan.md` for additional context when completing the tasks.
Implement the tasks in the task list. Focus on completing the tasks in the order they are listed. Mark the task complete as it is done by replacing the placeholder [ ] with [x]. As each step is completed, it is crucial to update the task list mark and the task as done [x].
